Project: A detection model that flags fraudlent credit card transactions using three Machine Learning Algorithms.

Algorithms Used: Ada Boost, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest.

Description: This project is a machine learning model which can detect fraud and genuine transactions in a dataset. The dataset used to train 
             this model is aquired from Kaggle. It has been trained on half of the dataset and the other half is used to test the model.
